# JavaLearningLab

This repository contains various code samples I created when learning features of the Java language and environment. Java 8 (build 1.8.0_71) was the version this started on.

## Note ##
The code here is demo code, **not** production level code and as such can contain some hardcoded references along with many extra comments that were written during development. In some places usernames and passwords will need to be added (*where you see asterisks*) along with your own connection details (*when it comes to database related code*) but otherwise everything placed in here compiles and executes.

Hope you find something of use here! :smile:
